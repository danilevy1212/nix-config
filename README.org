#+TITLE: Dan's nix config


* Introduction.

=nix= is a functional DSL (Domain Specific Language) for creating stable,
reproducible builds across many computers. It can be installed as a standalone
program in any linux distro and macOS or on top of it's own distro, =NixOS=.

This repo is a collection of ~.nix~ files that constitute the configuration of
dependencies of my system. This are located at the ~./config/nixpkgs/~ folder.
